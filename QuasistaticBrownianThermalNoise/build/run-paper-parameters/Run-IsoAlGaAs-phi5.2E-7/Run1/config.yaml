LaserBeam:
  # The beam shape. Choices are TEM00, TEM02, TEM20, TEM02minus20
  Profile: TEM00

  # The intensity profiles are proportional to exp(-(x*x+y*y)/Radius^2)
  # Radius has units of micrometers
  Radius: 152.3108006676

  # The strength of the laser beam and the applied pressure.
  # The thermal noise should be independent of this value.
  F0: 0.001

Mirror:
  # All mirror dimensions are in units of micrometers
  Dimensions:
    Radius: 12500.0
    SubstrateHeight: 12500.0
    CoatingThickness:   4.68

  # Material choices are AlGaAs (crystalline AlGaAs), Iso_FusedSilica,
  # Iso_AlGaAs (effective isotropic AlGaAs), and Iso_Ta2O5
  # The prefix Iso_ means isotropic.
  Materials:
    SubstrateMaterial: Iso_FusedSilica
    CoatingMaterial: Iso_AlGaAs

  # Mirror temperature in Kelvin, for computing the thermal noise.
  Temperature: 305.0

Resolution:
  # Refine the mesh each iteration, for Cycles iterations total. Higher
  # Cycles means run to higher resolution.
  Cycles: 10

  # Iterations for quadruature. Too small a value makes the integral of the
  # coating potential energy (and thus the coating thermal noise) inaccurate.
  QuadratureIterations: 10

# Run tests, instead of getting and outputting the solution?
Tests:
  RunTests: False
