This respository holds C++ code that numerically computes Brownian coating and substrate thermal noise for amorphic and crystalline materials. Results from this code are presented in https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1700183.

The primary requirement for compiling and running this code is the deal.II framework (http://www.dealii.org). 

Instructions for building this code, and example use cases, will be added here.
