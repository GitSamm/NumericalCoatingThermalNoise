This respository holds C++ code that numerically computes Brownian coating and substrate thermal noise for amorphic and crystalline materials. Results from this code are presented in https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1700183.

The primary requirement for compiling and running this code is the deal.II framework (http://www.dealii.org). 

Instructions for building this code, and example use cases, will be added here. Meanwhile, once you have installed deal.ii (dealii.org) and petsc (petsc.org) with the hypre package, you can build and run the code "QuasistaticThermalNoise.cpp" similarly to how you build and run the deal-ii step-8 tutorial (https://www.dealii.org/8.4.0/doxygen/deal.II/step_8.html).
